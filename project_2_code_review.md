## Clean Code:

- Code follows PEP-8
- Pickle your final dataframes so you easily access them 
- Create a separate notebook or file for scraping,cleaning, and modeling. For future projects try creating functions. These functions can then be 
  placed in py files. Then you can call the function from your jupyter notebook. 
- By creating py files for modeling it eliminates the redundancy of making column changes to the different splits

## Good Documentation:

- In your README.md, provide a clear scope and analysis, methodology, data science methods used, and summary of your findings.
- Use markdown cells at beginning of .ipynb to explain scope and analyis
- Inline code comments were well used.

## Proper Data Science:

- Code demonstrates good Linear Regression understanding. Good job working through model selection. 

## Comments:

- Good job on project 2! :)
- Loved the approach/project design of the project especially knowing you had a few struggles in the beginning.
  Don't get too down about scores from your model. Continue to focus on the data science skills and methods.
- For future projects, after modeling, spend time creating functions and py files to automate your process. This will save you time. 
- Make sure to create a summary/findings section
