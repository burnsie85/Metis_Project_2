NBA Player Stats to Predict Salary Model

Please start reviewing the code using the "Player Stats Web Scrape" notebook.

I commented this in the code, too, but you'll have to switch to the "Salary Webscrape" notebook about half way through the
"Player Stats Web Scrape" notebook.

At the end of the "Player Stats Web Scrape" notebook, you'll have to switch to the "Final Model" notebook.
